# Logistic-Regression-Assignment
# Introduction

Logistic Regression is a statistical method used to model the relationship between a binary dependent variable and one or more independent variables. In this project, we will be performing Logistic Regression on the bank-full.csv dataset to analyze the factors that influence a customer's decision to subscribe to a term deposit.

# Data Description

The bank-full.csv dataset contains 45211 rows and 17 columns. The columns include various features of the customer, such as their age, job, marital status, education, and more. The "y" column represents whether or not the customer subscribed to a term deposit.

# Methodology

We will be using Logistic Regression to model the relationship between the various features of the customer and their decision to subscribe to a term deposit. Logistic Regression assumes that there is a logistic function that models the probability of the dependent variable being a certain value given the independent variables. We will first visualize the relationship between the variables using a correlation matrix. Then we will fit a logistic regression model and check its accuracy using the confusion matrix and ROC curve. Finally, we will use the model to make predictions on new data.

# Results

Our analysis showed that several features of the customer are significant predictors of their decision to subscribe to a term deposit. The logistic regression model had an accuracy of 89.05%, indicating a strong correlation between the independent variables and the dependent variable.

Using the logistic regression model, we can make predictions on whether or not a customer will subscribe to a term deposit given their features.

# Conclusion

Logistic Regression is a powerful tool for modeling the relationship between binary variables. In this project, we used Logistic Regression to model the relationship between a customer's features and their decision to subscribe to a term deposit. Our analysis showed that several features of the customer are significant predictors of their decision to subscribe to a term deposit.

This model can be used by banks to estimate the likelihood of a customer subscribing to a term deposit given their features. It can also be used to identify which features are most important in predicting a customer's decision, allowing banks to target their marketing efforts more effectively.
